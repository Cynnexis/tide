Tide is an application that helps reduce panic attacks with a simple breathing exercise.

## :dart: Goals

Panic attacks can happen anywhere, at anytime.
In a world where we have access to a limitless number of digital resources at the tip of our fingers, we can reduce those attacks through different ways (apps, videos, etc.).
However, as I experienced multiple times, most of those resources are placed behind advertisements, which can be irritating or even aggravating depending on the content.
Those useful resources should always be available for people traversing those delicate moments, and have an ads-free experience.

Hence, I initiated **Tide**, a very simple app that help the user to calm themselves down by timing the breath in and breath out, and imitating the diaphragm dilatation, while being **free with no advertisements**.
As a result, anyone can have this application and use it with no stress of being disturbed by one of this awful and distressful ad.
